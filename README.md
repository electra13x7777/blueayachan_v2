## Blueayachan... But better!

### Roadmap
* Have BAC Join and Leave your chat using `!join` and `!leave`
* Command usage tracking on a per-channel basis
* Custom Commands
### Commands
* Dreamboumtweets ported. Follow [@dreamboum](https://twitter.com/Dreamboum) please!
* Demongacha ported (You can now save your previous demon with !savedemon and view it with #demongacha)
* HornedAnimeGacha is back!
* All classic fightgame main commands are back!
* An all new way to get your next speedgame from SRL!
* Pic command is back and better than before! (now supports multiple search tags) NOTE: 30s timeout between successful pic command per user

## General Usage
### Runtypes (A new feature in Version 2!!!)
* '!': GENERIC COMMAND - Is supposed to produce similar functionality to the previous bot. When in doubt use this!
* '?': HELP COMMAND - Should give information and help regarding that command. If you need help using a specific command run it with this!
* '#': SPECIAL COMMAND - Does the standard command with different functionality that is specific to the command itself.
### Get Started
* type `!help` to get a description of how the bot can be used.
* type `!cmds` to get a list of supported commands.
### Admin Features with !set
* A Broadcaster only command to help channel owners tailor bot use to their own needs! See the full documentation [here](https://pastebin.com/z6zxSiB5) or type `?set` in chat.
```
